# üêù tinyknock

eBPF (XDP) port knocking with a minimal firewall that filter the incoming traffic. It is compatible with the [knock](https://github.com/jvinet/knock) client.

The rules mechanism is inspired by [OpenState](https://sdn.ieee.org/newsletter/march-2017/openstate-an-interface-for-stateful-packet-processing-in-programmable-switches) but it is not designed for a switch.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è It is only experimental and should not run in production.
> 
> Note that every port knocking sequence should start with the port 0
> like `knock ipaddr 0 100 200 300`

## üìñ Build and run

You only need the following requirements (packages):
- `llvm`
- `clang`
- `make`
- `libcyaml`
- `libxdp`

### Debian / Ubuntu

```bash
apt install -y llvm clang make libcyaml-dev libxdp-dev
```

### RHEL / Fedora

```bash
dnf install -y llvm clang make libcyaml-devel libxdp-devel

# There are no official repositories for libcyaml
git clone https://github.com/tlsa/libcyaml
cd libcyaml
make VARIANT=release
make install VARIANT=release
cd ..
rm -rf libcyaml
```

You should also have `bpftool` if you need to debug.

To build, you should run the following command.
```bash
make
```

Then you can run.
```bash
./tinyknock -h
```

## ‚≠ê Use cases

To test the program, I have created two Linux network namespaces (both reachable by each other) following [this steps](https://medium.com/@technbd/creating-network-namespaces-in-linux-system-and-connecting-two-network-namespaces-using-virtual-6031d295f69b).

```bash
# Creates namespaces
ip netns add ns1
ip netns add ns2

# Creates two wirtual network interface peered
ip link add veth1 type veth peer name veth2

# Assigns virtual interface to the namespaces
ip link set veth1 netns ns1
ip link set veth2 netns ns2

# Assigns IP addresses to the virtual interfaces inside the namespaces
ip netns exec ns1 ip addr add 10.10.0.2/24 dev veth1
ip netns exec ns2 ip addr add 10.10.0.3/24 dev veth2

# Enables the virtual interfaces inside the namespaces
ip netns exec ns1 ip link set dev veth1 up
ip netns exec ns2 ip link set dev veth2 up
```

Now everything is setup, you can run the XDP program inside the first network namespace.

```bash
ip netns exec ns1 ./tinyknock -f file.yaml -b ./src/tinyknock.bpf.o -i veth1
```

And knock with the second one.

```bash
ip netns exec ns2 knock 10.10.0.2 0 1000 2000:udp 3000
```

If it worked, you should have a response like this:
```bash
ip netns exec ns2 knock 10.10.0.2 0 1000 2000:udp 3000

ip netns exec ns2 curl 10.10.0.2:8000
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 10.10.0.2 port 8000 after 0 ms: Couldn't connect to server
```

## üéâ Tasks

- [ ] Support ICMP protocol
- [ ] Implement the policies via YAML file
- [x] User log with a ring buffer
